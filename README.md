index.js code will listen for requests then send them to the web page script or the api script which will respond to the requests.

/pages/ folder are the files for the pages. You can change these to make it look pretty.

Heroku should automatically redeploy the app after updates so if there is any heroku errors just add a blank file and it should run again, if not, debug the code.
